                        <h3>Passage 1</h3>

                        <strong style="font-weight: bold;">A</strong><br> Our life span is restricted. Everyone accepts
                        this as 'biologically' obvious. 'Nothing lives for ever!' However, in this statement we think of
                        artificially produced, technical objects, products which are subjected to natural wear and tear
                        during use. This leads to the result that at some time or other the object stops working and is
                        unusable ('death' in the biological sense). But are the wear and tear and loss of function of
                        technical objects and the death of living organisms really similar or comparable?
                        <br><br><strong style="font-weight: bold;">B</strong><br>Our 'dead' products are 'static',
                        closed systems. It is always the basic material which constitutes the object and which, in the
                        natural course of things, is worn down and becomes 'older'. Ageing in this case must occur
                        according to the laws of physical chemistry and of thermodynamics. Although the same law holds
                        for a living organism, the result of this law is not inexorable in the same way. At least as
                        long as a biological system has the ability to renew itself it could actually become older
                        without ageing; an organism is an open, dynamic system through which new material continuously
                        flows. Destruction of old material and formation of new material are thus in permanent dynamic
                        equilibrium. The material of which the organism is formed changes continuously. Thus our bodies
                        continuously exchange old substance for new, just like a spring which more or less maintains its
                        form and movement, but in which the water molecules are always different.
                        <br><br><strong style="font-weight: bold;">C</strong><br>Thus ageing and death should not be
                        seen as inevitable, particularly as the organism possesses many mechanisms for repair. It is
                        not, in principle, necessary for a biological system to age and die. Nevertheless, a restricted
                        life span, ageing, and then death are basic characteristics of life. The reason for this is easy
                        to recognise: in nature, the existent organisms either adapt or are regularly replaced by new
                        types. Because of changes in the genetic material (mutations) these have new characteristics and
                        in the course of their individual lives they are tested for optimal or better adaptation to the
                        environmental conditions. Immortality would disturb this system - it needs room for new and
                        better life. This is the basic problem of evolution.
                        <br><br><strong style="font-weight: bold;">D</strong><br>Every organism has a life span which is
                        highly characteristic. There are striking differences in life span between different species,
                        but within one species the parameter is relatively constant. For example, the average duration
                        of human life has hardly changed in thousands of years. Although more and more people attain an
                        advanced age as a result of developments in medical care and better nutrition, the
                        characteristic upper limit for most remains 80 years. A further argument against the simple wear
                        and tear theory is the observation that the time within which organisms age lies between a few
                        days (even a few hours for unicellular organisms) and several thousand years, as with mammoth
                        trees.
                        <br><br><strong style="font-weight: bold;">E</strong><br>If a life span is a genetically
                        determined biological characteristic, it is logically necessary to propose the existence of an
                        internal clock, which in some way measures and controls the ageing process and which finally
                        determines death as the last step in a fixed programme. Like the life span, the metabolic rate
                        has for different organisms a fixed mathematical relationship to the body mass. In comparison to
                        the life span this relationship is 'inverted': the larger the organism the lower its metabolic
                        rate. Again this relationship is valid not only for birds, but also, similarly on average within
                        the systematic unit, for all other organisms (plants, animals, unicellular organisms).
                        <br><br><strong style="font-weight: bold;">F</strong><br>Animals which behave 'frugally' with
                        energy become particularly old, for example, crocodiles and tortoises. Parrots and birds of prey
                        are often held chained up. Thus they are not able to 'experience life' and so they attain a high
                        life span in captivity. Animals which save energy by hibernation or lethargy (e.g. bats or
                        hedgehogs) live much longer than those which are always active. The metabolic rate of mice can
                        be reduced by a very low consumption of food (hunger diet). They then may live twice as long as
                        their well fed comrades. Women become distinctly (about 1 o per cent) older than men. If you
                        examine the metabolic rates of the two sexes you establish that the higher male metabolic rate
                        roughly accounts .for the lower male life span. That means that they live life 'energetically' -
                        more intensively, but not for as long.
                        <br><br><strong style="font-weight: bold;">G</strong><br>It follows from the above that sparing
                        use of energy reserves should tend to extend life. Extreme high performance sports may lead to
                        optimal cardiovascular performance, but they quite certainly do not prolong life. Relaxation
                        lowers metabolic rate, as does adequate sleep and in general an equable and balanced
                        personality. Each of us can develop his or her own 'energy saving programme' with a little
                        selt-observatlon, critical self-control and, above all, logical consistency. Experience will
                        show that to live in this way not only increases the life span but is also very healthy. This
                        final aspect should not be forgotten.

                        <p>Exercise is a key factor in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It not only improves physical
                            fitness but also has numerous benefits for mental health. Regular exercise has been shown to
                            reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression by releasing endorphins, which are chemicals in
                            the brain that make you feel good. Furthermore, it helps improve sleep quality, boosts
                            self-esteem, and can increase brain function, making you feel more focused and alert.
                            Additionally, exercise plays a vital role in weight management. By burning calories, it
                            helps maintain a healthy weight, which reduces the risk of developing chronic diseases such
                            as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Experts recommend engaging in at least 150
                            minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, which can be broken down into 30-minute
                            sessions, five days a week. It’s important to find an exercise routine that works for you,
                            whether it’s walking, swimming, cycling, or yoga. Consistency is key to experiencing the
                            long-term benefits of exercise, making it essential to incorporate physical activity into
                            your daily routine.</p>
